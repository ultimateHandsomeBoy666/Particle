# particle

This is a handy android library for particle effect.

To start with, you need to add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```groovy
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```

Then add the dependency

```groovy
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.github.ultimateHandsomeBoy666:particle:0.1.0'
}
```
